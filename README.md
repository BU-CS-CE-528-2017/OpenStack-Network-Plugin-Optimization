# OpenStack-Network-Plugin-Optimization

Software based networking infrastructure is a major component of cloud infrastructure along with cloud compute and storage infrastructure. Workloads such as cryptography, deep packet inspection (DPI) and delay sensitive traffic transmission (such as video and financial data) require high performance networking. OpenStack provides cloud based networking services (layer 3 networking services includes NAT, static routing, etc.). Some OpenStack use cases require highly performant networking services. Therefore, Cisco has provided OpenStack Plugin support to offload networking services to specialized networking hardware. However, using this hardware is often expensive to use. This project will help users to determine the optimum way to router their network traffic through the cloud.
